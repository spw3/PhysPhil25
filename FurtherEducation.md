# Further Education
In my own studies, I have been blessed with the publicly accessible resources compiled by these individuals.
- Lecture notes for physics at Cambridge: https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/teaching.html
- Lecture notes for math at Cambridge: https://dec41.user.srcf.net/notes/
- Lecture notes for physics at Oxford: https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/subdepartment/rudolf-peierls-centre-theoretical-physics/theoretical-physics-teaching

For students who are genuinely interested in pursuing physics AND philosophy at university, here are the reading lists provided by the admissions teams of Oxford (https://insightoutreach.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Physics-and-Philosophy-Reading-List.pdf) and Cambridge (https://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/students/research-guide/philosophy-physics).

However, for a more representative experience of studying physics and philosophy at a graduate level, I recommend the Philosophy of Physics YT Channel (https://www.youtube.com/@OxfordPhilosophyofPhysics/videos), where some of the Thursday guest seminars at Oxford are recorded and posted for the public. You can find the full list of past topics and upcoming guests on this website (http://www.philosophy-of-physics.ox.ac.uk/tag/thursday-seminars/).

If you aren't sure, you may find this a useful litmus test for your own level of interest in metaphysics,
