# PhysPhil25
AHS Physics and Philosophy 25-26

The Physics and Philosophy Society is an excuse to bond over tea and biscuits. The most natural point to begin is of course... math! But where we go from there will depend on all of you. Recommended reading will be provided each week and by the end we will hopefully leave with a solid foundation in modern physics and a better understanding of the inextricable role of philosophy. Curiosity and an open-mind is 100% required. Experience in physics or philosophy is not (but definitely helpful). 



## Details
This repository is intended for my own personal use as an archive and a place to consolidate resources, given my propensity for losing all my files into an ether of unorganised mess. You may find the brief notes and recommended reading for each week in a separate file in the main directory. Some of the mathematical content can be challenging, but most if not all, of the interactive simulations shown are achievable projects that I would recommend coding for fun and to solidify your own understanding. 

That said, I was not prepared for the monumental undertaking of covering 4 years of university-level content in such a condensed fashion. I am current in the process of archiving all the resources I shared with my class this year (25-26) and I have also taken time to reflect on what I would do differently should I attempt this again.

In an ideal world, this is what I envision ready at the beginning of each week;

1. Question - Topic
2. Pre-Reading
3. Guiding Questions

And following our weekly session, I would update the archive with;

4. Philosophical Stances Discussed
5. Questions/Ideas Raised
6. Extensions



## Inspirations
This course structure is heavily inspired by PhysPhil at Oxford (https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/courses/course-listing/physics-and-philosophy).
- 1st Year: Introductory philosophy of physics. Philosophical topics in logic and probability.
- 2nd Year: Philosophy of science. Philosophy of special relativity. Thermal physics.
- 3rd Year: Philosophy of quantum mechanics. General relativity.

*For those more philosophy-inclined, navigate the Philosophy course (https://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/sitefiles/lecture-prospectus-tt25.pdf) at your own peril.

## Introductory Resources

## Further Education
In my own studies, I have been blessed with the publicly accessible resources compiled by these individuals.
Lecture notes for physics at Cambridge: https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/teaching.html
Lecture notes for math at Cambridge: https://dec41.user.srcf.net/notes/
Lecture notes for physics at Oxford: https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/subdepartment/rudolf-peierls-centre-theoretical-physics/theoretical-physics-teaching

For students who are genuinely interested in pursuing physics AND philosophy at university, here is the reading list provided by the admissions team (https://insightoutreach.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Physics-and-Philosophy-Reading-List.pdf). However, for a more representative experience of studying physics and philosophy at a graduate level, I highly recommend the Philosophy of Physics YT Channel (https://www.youtube.com/@OxfordPhilosophyofPhysics/videos), where some of the Thursday guest seminars at Oxford are recorded and posted for the public. You can find the full list of past guest lectures and upcoming seminars on this website (http://www.philosophy-of-physics.ox.ac.uk/tag/thursday-seminars/).

If you aren't sure, you may find this a useful litmus test for your own level of interest in metaphysics,
