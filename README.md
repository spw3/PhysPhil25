# PhysPhil25
AHS Physics and Philosophy 25-26

The Physics and Philosophy Society is an excuse to bond over tea and biscuits. The most natural point to begin is of course... math! But where we go from there will depend on all of you. Recommended reading will be provided each week. The goal is to leave with a solid foundation in modern physics and a better understanding of the inextricable role of philosophy at the end of the course. Curiosity and an open-mind is 100% required. Experience in physics or philosophy is not (but definitely helpful). 



## Details
This repository is intended for my own personal use as an archive and a place to consolidate resources, given my propensity for losing all my files into an ether of unorganised mess. You may find the brief notes and recommended reading for each week in a separate file in the main directory. Some of the mathematical content can be challenging, but most if not all, of the interactive simulations shown are achievable projects that I would recommend coding for fun and to solidify your own understanding. 

That said, I was not prepared for the monumental undertaking of covering 4 years of university-level content in such a condensed fashion. I am current in the process of archiving all the resources I shared with my class this year (25-26) and I have also taken time to reflect on what I would do differently should I attempt this again.

In an ideal world, this is what I envision ready at the beginning of each week;

1. Question - Topic
2. Pre-Reading
3. Guiding Questions

And following our weekly session, I would update the archive with;

4. Philosophical Stances Discussed
5. Questions/Ideas Raised
6. Extensions



## Inspirations
This course structure is heavily inspired by PhysPhil at Oxford (https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/courses/course-listing/physics-and-philosophy).
- 1st Year: Introductory philosophy of physics. Philosophical topics in logic and probability.
- 2nd Year: Philosophy of science. Philosophy of special relativity. Thermal physics.
- 3rd Year: Philosophy of quantum mechanics. General relativity.

*For those more philosophy-inclined, navigate the Philosophy course (https://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/sitefiles/lecture-prospectus-tt25.pdf) at your own peril.
