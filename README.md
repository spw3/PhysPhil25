AHS Physics and Philosophy 25-26

Course Outline
Week 1: The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics (Math as a structural science)
- Philosophical stances discussed: (a) the entire universe is math and perception is merely categorical labelling of math, (b) reality is inherently logical such that math is a tool for us to describe the structure, (c) reality exists independently and we have ascribed math to conveniently map patterns observed.
- Reading: Eugene Wigner (https://webhomes.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/wigner.pdf) and Max Tegmark (https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-the-universe-made-of-math-excerpt/)
- Extension: Gödel's incompleteness theorem and its relation to physics

Week 2: Early philosophical determinism and scientific determinism (from Stoicism to classical mechanics)
- Principia by Newton, The System of Nature by d'Holbach, Mécanique Analytique by Lagrange, A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities by Laplace
- Norton's Dome and pushback against determinism (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjZB81jCGj4, https://sites.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/Goodies/Dome/#Note%206)

Week 3: Chaos and unpredictability within deterministic frameworks (Chaos Theory)
- Lorentz Attractors vs Strange Attractors
- Using ensembles to estimate predictability (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkiEV47KPX4)
- Ontological limitation or physical limitation? (On continuous space-time or discrete LQG)

  Refining our definitions of determinism and predictability.

Week 4*: Tangential discussion on current LLMs
- Deconstructing the difference between algorithms vs ML vs AI
- The mathematics behind basic feedforward neural networks and the backpropagation algorithm

Week 5*: Halloween
- Demons and Monsters in modern physics
- The role of thought experiments in probing limitations of a framework while remaining within it

Week 6: Black swans and Two-Colored sheep (Bayesian inference in probability)
- The inherent probabilistic nature of science and knowledge. Understanding Baye's theorem.
- Probability distribution functions and the mathematical requirements for convergence between frequentist interpretations and Bayesian interpretations.

Week 7: N/a
- Missing most members. Ended up asking why different members joined initially as well as why they've stayed.

Week 8: Wave-particle duality and decomposition of orthogonal bases (Quantum Mechanics)
- Fixing misconceptions about duality. Understanding wavefunctions and QM as a probabilistic framework. Venn diagrams and Non-Boolean math.
- Bell's Inequality and its ramifications of hidden variables vs non-locality.

Week 9: Interpretations of QM (Quantum Mechanics)
- Wave-function collapse and the many propositions to reconcile our experience with the math behind QM.
- Many-worlds. Measurement.

Week 10: The axiomization of constructive theories in physics (Thermodynamics)
- Hilbert's sixth problem and the asymptotic limits between classical mechanics, thermodynamics, and fluid dynamics. (extension: QM-based statistical mechanics)
- The proof that truncation error converges to zero always.

Week 11: Time irreversibility as en emergent phenomenon (Statistical Mechanics)
- Time reversibility of fundamental physical frameworks. Symmetries and conservation laws from Nöether's theorem.
- Standard derivation of Boltzmannian entropy from macrostate statistics and understanding complexity defined as local-deviations from an homogeneous isotropic space.

Week 12: N/a
- Missing most members. Ended up discussing the ethics of human drug trials. Fairness in terms of voluntary vs random, whilst ackowledging hidden societal pressures as a potential factor. Value of life, human superiority, and removal of human rights. Outcome-based analysis with retroactive knowledge vs assigning values on an unknown future outcome. Sunk-cost fallacy.

Week 13: N/a
- Cancelled

Week 14: A principle theory of reality (General Relativity)
- Showing the principles of Action Principle, Locality, Lorentz invariance, and Gauge symmetry within the Einstein field equations.
- Recovering Newtonian limits and gravitational waves from the energy momentum tensor.

Week 15+: Student presentations
